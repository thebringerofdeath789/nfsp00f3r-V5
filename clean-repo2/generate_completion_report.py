NFSP00F3R V5.00 - IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY
==================================================

File: IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY (printed only; no new file created)
Authors: Gregory King & Matthew Braunschweig
Date: August 16, 2025
Description: Concise, accurate summary of implementation status for the
NFSP00F3R V5.0 project. This script prints the status to stdout and does
not create any new markup files (per the repository constraint).

This document summarizes the state of work completed to address UI
functionality, Android integration, and test organization for the
NFSP00F3R V5.0 project. The emphasis in this summary is on accuracy and
on clearly identifying outstanding device-level validation work.

# NFSP00F3R V5.0 - IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY (STATUS: PARTIAL)

## Summary
- Objective: Port, audit, and harden the Android companion app into
  `android_companion/` using on-disk JSON storage for profiles (no Room),
  make Emulation the default landing screen, and prepare a reproducible
  debug build.

## Current status (local verification)
- UI wiring: Most Compose and desktop UI controls have been wired to
  business logic and covered by unit/JVM tests where feasible. Some
  Compose instrumentation and on-device UI behaviors still require
  device verification.
- BLE/HCE integration: Core BLE peripheral and HCE helper paths (including
  an IsoDep APDU helper) have been added; runtime permission handling for
  advertising/connection has been implemented.
- Persistence: `CardProfileManager` saves and loads profiles directly to
  disk (JSON) and is used by Emulation and Database screens.
- Protocol parity: `MessageFragmentManager` parity for BLE
  fragmentation/reassembly implemented and unit-tested (pure-JVM). Python
  desktop fragmentation tests were executed and passed locally.

## Outstanding (requires hardware/device validation)
- Build and run `assembleDebug` on a properly provisioned Android build
  host and validate APK on representative devices.
- Execute BLE ↔ Android ↔ POS end-to-end tests (session export/import, APDU
  relay timing). These require real hardware (Android device, POS
  reader, PN532) and are not executed here.
- Add and run Android instrumentation (Compose) tests that verify UI
  flows and HCE timing on devices/emulators.
- CI device/instrumentation integration (device farm or emulator matrix).

## Notes
- This script intentionally does not create a new Markdown file. To
  comply with the "do not create new markup files" constraint, it prints
  a concise, accurate status summary to stdout. The canonical progress and
  audit documents were updated directly in `docs/` to reflect the
  accurate, partial state. If persistent machine-readable output is
  required, update an existing document under `docs/` rather than creating
  a new top-level markup file.
